### 2.2.1. This is a level 3 heading

There are also single and double hashtag titles for level 1 and 2 - but I wanted to keep my table of contents for this tutorial clean and tidy :)

You can also type some text here.

This is how you do something in **bold** or _italics_

Then you can make a list of bullet points:

* 1, 2, 3
* A, B, C
* what about an indented bullet?
  + as easy as it gets!

1. What if you want numbered lists?
2. As easy as this!

We can also add images using a few methods as long as the file is in the right path!

<img alt="alternate text goes here" src="lets-do-this.jpg" width="60%" />

![You can add some alternate text here](doh.jpg)

Finally - we can add code chunks like so to have SQL syntax highlighting turned on:

```sql
SELECT * FROM some_table
```

Or you can have code in-line like this `SELECT * FROM some_table` but the syntax highlighting won't on for these in-line code snippets.

If you want to highlight something you can also use blockquotes:

> Something you really want to emphasise

You can also do page breaks using three underscores together like below to slightly separate sections of your document

Finally we can also include external links to websites like [https://www.google.com]
